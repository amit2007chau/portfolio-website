# Issues to Fix

1.  **Broken Navigation Links**: Some navbar links scroll to wrong sections or don’t work at all. Fix anchor tags and IDs.
2.  **CSS Not Applying on About Section**: The About section isn’t picking up the styles from `style.css`. Identify and fix the selector mismatch.
3.  **Add a Projects Section**: Create a simple grid-based “Projects” section with 3 sample project cards.
4.  **Improve Mobile Responsiveness**: Website breaks on screen sizes below 480px. Add responsive CSS rules.
5.  **Fix Misaligned Footer Icons**: Social media icons in the footer are misaligned. Correct their spacing and alignment.
